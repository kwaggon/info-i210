## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

My proposed project is a website that archives indigenous American arts and teaches people how to make them-- preserving these traditional art mediums.

### Core Webpages

Core web pages would be:

Home - A brief description about the purpose of the website and a landing page with easy navigation.
Arts Archive - There would be a drop down menu with the different art mediums, but if you click on "arts archive" in the navigation, it will take you to a catalog you can search and filter to find a specific type of art.
[Art type: i.e; Beadwork] - When you find an art that you like and click it, it will take you the page that talks about the history and provides gif or video tutorials on how to create that art.
Tribes - This page would talk about the different tribes featured in this website and their artisanal specialties. To keep things simple, it would probably only feature the tribes found in Indiana or the Great Lakes Region.

### Design Choices

https://www.instructables.com/projects was a big influence for this project.

https://shawnee-nsn.gov/slip/ and https://miamination.com/ will be the color scheme base:Red, Gold and Turquoise
